      <strong>Regimented Forces</strong>
      If a player has more regiments than their opponent at the start of the battle, then once per battle, that player can re-roll their priority roll after seeing the result of both players' rolls but before determining priority for that battle round.

      <strong>Obscured Ghyranite Objectives</strong>
      Some abilities can confer the 'Obscuring' terrain ability on a Ghyranite Objective, even though it is not a terrain feature. In these cases, replace the words 'within 1" of this terrain feature' in the ability with 'wholly within this Ghyranite objective's control zone'.

  - id: endOfTurn
    information: |
      <strong>Paired Objectives</strong>
      When a player has to pick a 'pair of objectives', they can only pick a single pair of Ghyranite objectives of the same type. For example that player could pick either both <strong>Oakenbrow</strong> objectives and/or both <strong>Gnarlroot</strong> objectives. They could not pick an <strong>Oakenbrow</strong> objective and a <strong>Gnarlroot</strong> objective, or both <strong>Oakenbrow</strong> objectives and both <strong>Gnarlroot</strong> objectives.

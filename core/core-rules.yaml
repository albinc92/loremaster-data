  - id: startOfBattleRound
    information: |
      <p>At the start of each battle round, follow these steps in order:</p>
      
      <h4>Battle Round Setup:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Determine the Active Player:</strong> If it is the first battle round, the player who finished setting up their army first decides who will take the first turn (unless otherwise specified in the battlepack or battleplan). If it is not the first battle round, the players make a roll-off called the priority roll and the winner decides who will take the first turn. If the roll-off is a tie, the player who took the first turn in the previous battle round decides who will take the first turn in the current battle round.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine the Underdog:</strong> Whichever player has the fewest victory points is the underdog for the battle round. If the players are tied (e.g. in the first battle round), then there is no underdog, unless otherwise specified.</li>
        <li><strong>Start of Battle Round Abilities:</strong> The active player can use any Start of Battle Round abilities first, then their opponent can do the same.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Key Rules:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When it is a player's turn, regardless of whether they take the first or second turn, they are referred to as the active player</li>
        <li>The underdog gains additional benefits in some rules and battlepacks</li>
        <li>Each battle lasts a number of battle rounds, specified in the battleplan</li>
      </ul>

  - id: deployment
    information: |
      <h4>Deployment Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1 - Deploy Faction Terrain Features:</strong> Some factions have faction terrain features, which have their own warscrolls and are set up using DEPLOY TERRAIN abilities. The player who begins deployment must use DEPLOY TERRAIN abilities first, followed by their opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 - Deploy Armies:</strong> Unless otherwise specified in the battleplan, the players alternate using DEPLOY abilities to deploy their units, starting with the player who begins deployment. Once one player has no more DEPLOY abilities to use, their opponent must continue to use DEPLOY abilities until they also have no more to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3 - Use Deployment Phase Abilities:</strong> After both players have finished deploying their units, the player who begins deployment can use any Deployment Phase abilities that are not DEPLOY or DEPLOY TERRAIN abilities, in the order of their choosing, then their opponent can do the same.</li>
      </ol>

    information: |
      <h3>Start of Turn</h3>
      <p>At the start of each player's turn, certain abilities and effects may trigger. This occurs before the Hero Phase begins.</p>
      
      <h4>Turn Structure:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Each battle round contains 2 turns</li>
        <li>The player whose turn is taking place is the active player</li>
        <li>Each turn contains 7 phases: Hero, Movement, Shooting, Charge, Combat, End of Turn, and potentially Start of Turn abilities</li>
        <li>In each phase, the active player uses abilities first, then their opponent does the same</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Phase Timing:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Start of Turn abilities trigger before the Hero Phase</li>
        <li>Some abilities specifically require "Start of Your Turn" or "Start of Enemy Turn" timing</li>
        <li>The active player resolves their Start of Turn abilities first, then their opponent</li>

        <li>No more than 1 friendly WIZARD can cast the same spell per turn unless it has the UNLIMITED keyword</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Prayer Rules:</h4>

        <li>Make a chanting roll of D6. On an unmodified 1, the prayer fails and remove D3 ritual points from the PRIEST</li>
        <li>On a 2+, either give ritual points equal to the roll to the PRIEST, or add ritual points to the roll and if it equals or exceeds the prayer's chanting value, it is answered</li>

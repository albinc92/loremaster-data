      <ol>
        <li><strong>Determine the Active Player:</strong> If it is the first battle round, the player who finished setting up their army first decides who will take the first turn (unless otherwise specified in the battlepack or battleplan). If it is not the first battle round, the players make a roll-off called the priority roll and the winner decides who will take the first turn. If the roll-off is a tie, the player who took the first turn in the previous battle round decides who will take the first turn in the current battle round.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine the Underdog:</strong> Whichever player has the fewest victory points is the underdog for the battle round. If the players are tied (e.g. in the first battle round), then there is no underdog, unless otherwise specified.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Unit can move distance up to the value of the charge roll</li>
        <li>Unit can move through combat ranges of any enemy units</li>
        <li>Must end move within 1/2" of a visible enemy unit to complete the charge</li>
        <li>If successful, the unit using this ability has charged</li>

        <li>An objective remains in your control until your opponent gains control of it</li>

        A target model is visible to another model (which we’ll call the ‘observing model’) if you can draw a straight line through the air (whether horizontal, diagonal or vertical) from any point on the observing model to any point on the target model that does not intersect any objects except for other models in the observing model’s unit. A target unit is visible to an observing unit if at least 1 model in the target unit is visible to at least 1 model in the observing unit. A model is always considered to be visible to itself.
        If a rule or ability requires a target to be both within a given range of and visible to the unit using that ability, or to a model in that unit, both conditions must be met by the same model in the target. You could not, for instance, target a unit where one model is within range but not visible and another model is not in range but is visible.
